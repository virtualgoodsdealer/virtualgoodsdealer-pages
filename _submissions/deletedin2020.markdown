Have you had any posts deleted from Instagram in the past year? You can submit them to our upcoming web exhibit, Deleted in 2020. 

We will be hosting up to 100 images deleted by Instagram on Virtualgoodsdealer Pages.
We hope to facilitate online experiences outside of big tech platforms and the limits of their conservative terms of service policies, while centering interesting, creative media over clout and art world prestige.

At this time, we are looking for static image posts, including both feed and story posts, deleted by Instagram for any reason. Anyone can submit to our exhibit.

Please email your submission to [vgdsubmissions@gmail.com](mailto:vgdsubmissions@gmail.com?subject=Deleted%20In%202020%20Submission). Write “Deleted In 2020 Submission” in the Subject field. You can attach your image files directly to the email, or include a drive/download link.

For each image displayed in the exhibit, we will provide space for a description. We suggest using this space to provide context such as your username, what it was deleted for, and thoughts/reflections. You can write as much or little as you want. You can also choose not to include descriptions, and we will leave the space blank in the exhibit.

If you choose to use descriptions, please write the description for each image in the body of your email, and specify the file name of the corresponding image.

We also understand that privacy may be a concern, especially if you are submitting content that is sensitive in any way. We will not share any information about you outside of the descriptions you provide.

There is no limit on the number of images you can submit. However, we will prioritize including all the creators who submit, rather than all the images from each creator.

Submissions close Dec. 31, 2020.

If you have any technical issues or need clarifications before you submit to us, please email us at [vgdsubmissions@gmail.com](mailto:vgdsubmissions@gmail.com?subject=Deleted%20In%202020%20Submission) and we will be happy to help. Our process is experimental and we do not want technical issues to prevent anybody from being a part of our exhibit.
