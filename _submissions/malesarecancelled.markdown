We are opening the @males_are_cancelled Instagram account for takeovers.

The goal of the takeovers is to magnify the voices of those whose reach and creative expression have been suppressed by the racist, classist, and ableist structures of social media platforms and the creative industries.

Takeovers will be held once a month. We plan for each takeover to last 3 days, or 72 hours, but we are open to making exceptions on a case-by-case basis. During the takeover, you will gain full access to the account including feed posts, story posts, IGTV, Reels, and DMs. Feel free to utilize all these features to the max.

<a href="https://forms.gle/PPu2tM5g1YMyhUb97" target="_blank">You can sign up by filling out this interest form.</a>

Only serious responses will be considered. Priority will be given to QTPOC.

If you are selected, we will reach out to you directly via your preferred method of communication to schedule your takeover. Thank you!
