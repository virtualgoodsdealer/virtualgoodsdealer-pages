We are looking for web art submissions to display on the [exhibits](/exhibits) page.
The piece can have any focus (art, games, experiences, etc) or subject matter but it must be interactive and accessible from the browser. We are prioritizing pieces that are not hosted on major social media platforms. Check out our [exhibits](/exhibits) page to see examples of pieces we have accepted previously.

We are willing to work with you to figure out the best way to display your work, so please feel free to reach out with any questions.

You can email your submission to [vgdsubmissions@gmail.com](mailto:vgdsubmissions@gmail.com?subject=Web%20Art%20Submission). Please write “Web Art Submission” in the subject field.
