Currently, virtualgoodsdealer pages is run on a volunteer basis by three people. Every week, we spend a lot of our time creating new content for pages, curating community submitted works, as well as developing the pages website. We have decided to start seeking donations so that we can continue to do so!

Your donations will go towards our efforts to expand our site, create larger projects, and commission contributors. If you are enjoying our content and would like to support us, we would really appreciate it! Any donation amount would help us, no matter how small. In addition to our gratitude, you will also receive a shoutout in the next virtualgoodsdealer produced video.
