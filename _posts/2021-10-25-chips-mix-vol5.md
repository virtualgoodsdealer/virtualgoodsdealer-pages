post_description: CHIPS is a mix series I use to explore & work out whatever moods I’m in, much like how I started going out clubbing to work that out on a dancefloor. The title is an acronym (Computers Having Intense Passionate Sex) that comes from a friend of a friend’s description of my DJing style.

CHIPS is a mix series I use to explore & work out whatever moods I'm in, much like how I started going out clubbing to work that out on a dancefloor. The title is an acronym (Computers Having Intense Passionate Sex) that comes from a friend of a friend's description of my DJing style.

Besides imaginary discreet android encounters, I want these to feel more oriented towards headphone or small-space listening. The track selection is a blend of tracks that drive forward along with those that employ a laid-back touch, sweeping pads & more spacious, ambient ideas. There's some extremely recognizable choices along with deep-dive youtube-rabbit-hole finds, archival selections from my years of minimal techno fandom, & some of my major tentpole influences.
