This is the first part of a three part series on creating your own static website for complete beginners. <!--more--> First, we will discuss *why* you may want to code your own website. Then, I will go over how to set up your development environment and how to use github pages to host your site. Finally, I will suggest resources for learning how to build a site from scratch and how to use templates of websites that are compatible with github pages. Everything used in this tutorial is free! All you need is a computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux) and an internet connection to get started.

For those of you that are already familiar with basic programming, this is the breakdown of the technologies/frameworks I'm going over step by step in this tutorial series:
- bash
- code editor
- git
- github and github pages
- jekyll (optional)  

If that list meant nothing to you, that is completely okay! You will be using all of these if you follow the steps in this tutorial series.
