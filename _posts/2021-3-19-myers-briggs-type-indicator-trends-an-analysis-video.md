	I decided to ask some meme page owners what MBTI they identified as and I couldnâ€™t help but notice some trends.
</p>

Then I decided to make a video, spending 70+ hours interviewing and researching all kinds of different meme pages using my obsessive MBTI knowledge. I spent another week of pretty much non-stop editing on Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere, making sure that my video would be just as entertaining as it was informative. Featuring digital collages by me.
