Hello, I am JAGUAR from Atlanta, GA.

I spin predominately deconstructed club and hardcore club tracks ar raves into the earliest hours of the night; this is what Hard Dance means to me. Hard Dance is a lifeline for me, a language in itself. 

It is a sound that is difficult to find in Atlanta and I am proud to be a part of leading the movement here. I have been organizing raves in Atlanta with [Malware Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/malwarecafe/){:target="_blank"}, a BIPOC rave/DJ collective based in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Our initiative is geared towards bringing harder, faster, and expansive sounds through raves & events to the underground DJ and music scene in the city while also creating spaces that promote, sustain, and redistribute resources to BIPOC artists. 

I opened up for Jasmine Infiniti on November 13th at Aisle 5. This live mix was intended to feel like a narrative or a "journey". There is a pleasurable amount of baile funk, hardstyle, hard tech, drumline, gabber, and club flips intertwined all throughout this hour ensemble. I hope you all enjoy it. <3333
