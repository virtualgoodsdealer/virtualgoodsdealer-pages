We began our first iteration of Virtualgoodsdealer Creators a month ago on October 6th and it has been a unique and rewarding experience! This post is a lookback on our experiences, as the organizers of Virtualgoodsdealer, and a feature on all the participants who released products with us this month. <!--more-->

This month we featured work from [Charming Sprite Shop by cyber_sprite](/creatordirectory/cyber_sprite), [Juriel Furukawa](/creatordirectory/jurielfurukawa), [demonmercen](/creatordirectory/demonmercen), [Soft_G0th](/creatordirectory/soft_g0th), [Steph Lau](/creatordirectory/stephlau), [Zines by Jackie](/creatordirectory/zinesbyjackie), [Hillary R](/creatordirectory/hillaryr), and [Skullfucked](/creatordirectory/skullfucked). Here we are sharing some more about each creator and their inspiration and goals.

>I love online shopping because I can take my sweet time. I also like that I can support artists that I admire from around the world, directly, rather than a corporation.
>-cyber_sprite

[cyber_sprite](/creatordirectory/cyber_sprite) is based on Los Angeles, CA and is currently inspired by N64 Graphics and kandi culture. We were drawn to her work because of eyecatching multilayered holographic designs and the references to internet culture and technology theory. 

**Q: If you could have an infinite budget for one creative project, what would you make?**  
cyber_sprite: I would love to develop a mixed-reality VR experience with social elements, IRL items, and popup-type events that coincide with in-game events and lore; something that could connect people online and off.

**Q: Favorite meme?**  
cyber_sprite: The glitter girl from the “coming back from the club” vine. Legendary queen!

>The F\*\*\* You - T combines the body and performance to create typographical piece. The F\*\*\* You T on a deeper read reclaims the body and its subjugation to false stereotyping. However, it does also just exist as a bunch of fuck you's to whatever it is you want to express that to.
>-Juriel Furukawa

[Juriel Furukawa](/creatordirectory/jurielfurukawa) is an artist and designer based in New York City. Her study centers around the relationship between performance art and motion graphics, with a particular interest in the different modality of self duplication.

**Q: How do you feel about online shopping?**   
Juriel: less frequent than before! I love how much more access I have to more independent sellers, but feel like I can spend too long looking at things. I do enjoy the immediate feeling of desire and love than comes from seeing an item in person

That's all our creators for October! We are continuing to release new items by different creators every week throughout November at [virtualgoodsdealer.com](virtualgoodsdealer.com). Virtualgoodsdealer is organized and run by [Cindie Xin](/creatordirectory/cindiexin) and [@ada.wrong](/creatordirectory/adawrong). Here's some reflections on our Virtualgoodsdealer creators experience so far:

>Thank you to all the participants and everyone that submitted to our open call. This was an experimental concept and we appreciate everyone's patience during the process! As a person tied to material things, I wanted to explore a different approach towards online shopping, the value of items, the definition of a product, the idea of luxury, and running an e-commerce business. We are only hoping to go bigger in scale and more abstract on future Virtualgoodsdealer projects. I hope you enjoy the items you have purchased and the new items we are dropping next month!
>-@ada.wrong

>Wow, it seems like it was just yesterday that we posted our open call. The initial positive response we received far exceeded our expectations, and since then we have been working hard to create an e-commerce platform that prioritizes independent artists and creatives, while also being a smooth and reliable shopping experience for buyers. From shooting and editing product photos, to social media promotion, to building out our Pages site (that you're on now!), we have tried to take an approach that maintains our ideals and aesthetic. My favorite part of this process has definitely been meeting and working with our extremely talented creators, all of whom I have learned a great deal from and been deeply inspired by.
>Thank you to everybody who has stuck around since we were called Mimi Apparel. And thank you to those who recently learned about Virtualgoodsdealer. We are grateful to have the opportunity and platform to experiment and grow.
