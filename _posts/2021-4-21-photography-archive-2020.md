  I took this photo of her at Ivy Tech. There's a certain room there that reminds me of Greece due to the marble and pillars. People rarely sat in there and due to it being the holidays, I figured it would be a great place to go. Although the theme for our looks that day was based around cybergoths, I found Jhovanni's look very angelic. I asked her to sit in the window because I felt as though it suited her. After shooting and returning to our homes, I spent an hour trying to decide what to do with this photo. I settled with a simple wing edit. It wasn't until Saturday, December 19 that I decided to add elements to make the photo pop. If you look to the right, the wings reflect on the marble wall. Not only that, but the filter has an edge blur effect that makes Jhovanni the focal point. Not my best work, but certainly my favorite.

  I took this photo of Jhovanni outside of Ivy tech. It was a small area. A bush surrounded by benches I believe. Due to cold weather and uncomfortable outfits, we were pretty tired. I remember Jhovanni taking a seat. The sunlight reflected off her face and an idea shot into my brain. I had our friends gather around her and place their hands on her. As I stated before, she looked angelic that day. So, my idea was sort of a nod to someone being baptized. My first edit of this photo was just a touch up and a light filter, but when I scrolled up on it again, I got an 'ah-hah!' moment. I started off by removing the background. I wanted Jhovanni to be the focus. Obviously that meant getting rid of the bodies that the hands belonged to. Then, I was stuck with floating hands. Well, angelic beings are shiny I suppose, so I brightened each person's hand. To add a bit of <b><i>oomf</i></b>, I gave Jhovanni some tears despite her smile. I like to play around with filters. That's why there's three of one image (LMAO).

  Despite my obsession with Jhovanni's look that day, Daniel was the one I kept taking photos of. Her photogenic personality attracted my camera lense. While Jhovanni reminded me of an angel, Daniel reminded me of something fierce. Like a cat! (Hence the edits). Not just any cat, but a Jaguar or a Leopard. The first photo ended up sitting in my Google drive, unedited, because I had no idea what to do with it. Daniel was on the phone, so I took off guard photos of her. I loved the facial expression. I attempted to add in cats, but they didn't suit the original background. After wracking my brain, I decided to give Daniel split pupils and cat ears (first photo). The background still did not suit anything. I ended up saving the photo and scrolling through my favorite Vaporwave app. I scrolled until I came upon that lion wallpaper. I saved it, cut Daniel out of the horrific background in the original photo, and placed her in front of the lion. With the touch of a bronze filter, an amazing photo with a very low quality was born! The second photo was previously edited. I had already added a motion blur and golden eyes. I didn't want to leave it that way though. Since I had that cat theme going on for Daniel, I gave her some cat ears and claws. She's hugging a pillar in the original photo, but zoomed in it looks like a scratch post (at least I think so).

  The only thing I can say about these edits of one photo is that I was bored. I don't even remember my thought process or what I did, because it was A LOT! The first two haven't been posted anywhere. Instagram gives them a black background that they're not supposed to have. The original photo was simple. Maddie sitting in geese poop grass. The first time I edited this photo I just did a touch up and added saturation. Maddie tends to look like a mythical creature in the photos I take of her. Since I re-edited other photos, I gave this one a go. No Maddie has fairy wings and is sitting in an alternate universe.

  This was a hectic day. It was cold, I wasn't dressed for walking, Apollo has epilepsy and I kept forgetting to turn off the flash. I felt so bad. Thank God he didn't seize. We took several photos. This one, like many, ended up in the unedited folder. I had already edited so many so I just tossed this one to the side. After looking at it again, I realized that Apollo was sitting on a throne. He seemed very confident and comfortable in this particular photo. Since our looks were inspired by Hades and Persephone, I did an edit to give off an underworld feel. Stair that leads into the abyss. A powerful being blocking the path. Can this image get any more powerful?

  I was getting ready for class and noticed that I looked similar to Tomie. She's a beautiful character that belongs to Junji Ito. With some time to myself, I set my camera up in the window by my stair, sat down, and posed. It took a few tries to get my pose right. Sometimes my head would be too tilted or my fingers were off. I am extremely satisfied with this photo. I look as elegant as Tomie. I was also able to give the illusion of having long slender fingers. That smirk can definitely not be trusted.

  Believe it or not this was taken in my garage. For some reason the back door was located in the garage and it had a latch lock. That's not important. Anyway I had a white wig, white wings, and a white dress. The sun was in the perfect spot, so I didn't use flash. I adored these photos and I knew they needed something. I glanced over at my pair of undies that had 'alone' written on them. What if you woke up and everyone was gone? That's what I tried to emulate here. I removed my backyard and replaced it with a zombie town. After that, I added a filter that gave off a gloomy effect. It all came together beautifully. A photo like this can definitely make someone anxious.

  I had gotten out of cosplay due to the toxic community, but that didn't stop me from going all out for Halloween. I haven't watched The Shining since I was a child. To this very day I remember Shelley Duvall's role as Wendy Torrance. She did an outstanding job. I was enamored by her facial expressions. In order to recreate her amazing work, I practiced facial expressions in the mirror for hours. I also had to force teary eyes (I do not recommend. It can take a toll on your mental health). Remembering things that frightened me helped as well. With all that, I added a drama effect. I love these photos, but why did no one tell me my fly was unzipped?

  This was so, so, so much fun! My mom had bought me a pair of yellow high heels the previous day. Not only is yellow one of my favorite colors, but the heels are dollar signs! The next morning I put on the vintage sailor top I borrowed from a friend, an ankle length black skirt, and black stockings. I didn't brush my hair. I thought the bedhead suited the aesthetic. Then I packed up my camera and tripod and took a trip to the dog park. The sun shines directly on a bench that's in front of the neighborhood pond. After a few attempted shots, I ended up with this lovely photo. Now, it didn't look this good from the get go. At first, it was dull. I turned up the saturation and edited my skin to a bit more yellowish than pinkish. That way I could match my shoes!

  I'm one heck of a goofball if I do say so myself. My mullet made me feel supermodel material, but I'm only serious in front of the camera for a short amount of time. Maybe I should make a 3am selfie archive.

  Heavily inspired by the kidcore aesthetic. I wanted to look like a spider, but I also wanted to look like a schoolgirl.

  Evangelion is not my favorite anime, but it has some beautiful aesthetic that I absolutely adore.

  I have no idea why I decided to make myself look like a bug, but the motion blur with a b&w filter was inspired by some photographer I saw on Pinterest. I'm not sure what the aesthetic is called. I look so creepy (so cute!)!

  This shoot was initially a recreation of the little red riding hood. Due to the lack of color, it became something completely different. I find these photos distasteful and I honestly hate them, but I'm also obsessed with the uniqueness of them (I guess).

  At first, I wanted to do a Cosplay of Rei from Evangelion. Then, I realized not only was my hair too blue, but also too short. So I did what any other creative person would do. I had fun.

Thank you for taking the time to look through my photography archive for 2020. It's been a rough year! I'm proud of you for making it through. If you enjoyed my work please follow me [@r3_echo](https://www.instagram.com/r3_echo) on Instagram. This was a bit irritable to make, but I'm excited to start my archive for 2021!
