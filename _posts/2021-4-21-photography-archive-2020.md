        I took this photo of her at Ivy Tech. There's a certain room there that reminds me of Greece due to the marble and pillars. People rarely sat in there and due to it being the holidays, I figured it would be a great place to go. Although the theme for our looks that day was based around cybergoths, I found Jhovanni's look very angelic. I asked her to sit in the window because I felt as though it suited her. After shooting and returning to our homes, I spent an hour trying to decide what to do with this photo. I settled with a simple wing edit. It wasn't until Saturday, December 19 that I decided to add elements to make the photo pop. If you look to the right, the wings reflect on the marble wall. Not only that, but the filter has an edge blur effect that makes Jhovanni the focal point. Not my best work, but certainly my favorite.

        I took this photo of Jhovanni outside of Ivy tech. It was a small area. A bush surrounded by benches I believe. Due to cold weather and uncomfortable outfits, we were pretty tired. I remember Jhovanni taking a seat. The sunlight reflected off her face and an idea shot into my brain. I had our friends gather around her and place their hands on her. As I stated before, she looked angelic that day. So, my idea was sort of a nod to someone being baptized. My first edit of this photo was just a touch up and a light filter, but when I scrolled up on it again, I got an 'ah-hah!' moment. I started off by removing the background. I wanted Jhovanni to be the focus. Obviously that meant getting rid of the bodies that the hands belonged to. Then, I was stuck with floating hands. Well, angelic beings are shiny I suppose, so I brightened each person's hand. To add a bit of <b><i>oomf</i></b>, I gave Jhovanni some tears despite her smile. I like to play around with filters. That's why there's three of one image (LMAO).

Thank you for taking the time to look through my photography archive for 2020. It's been a rough year! I'm proud of you for making it through. If you enjoyed my work please follow me [@r3_echo](https://www.instagram.com/r3_echo) on Instagram. This was a bit irritable to make, but I'm excited to start my archive for 2021!
