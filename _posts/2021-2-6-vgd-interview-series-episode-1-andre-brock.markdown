This is the first episode of Virtualgoodsdealer Interview Series, where we will be having conversations with artists, scholars, and internet personalities on their work and experiences.

Our one-hour discussion revolved around the strange relationship between outrage and justice, and the digital manifestations of this phenomenon.
