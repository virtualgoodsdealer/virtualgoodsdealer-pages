Virtualgoodsdealer pages is digital space featuring writing, tutorials, and other media. It was created as a direct response to the media submissions to our first open call, but we hope to expand the definitions of this space to include net art and other interactive media.

Pages also hosts our [creator directory](/creatordirectory) which lists all creators we have worked with in the past. This includes creators whose work we have stocked on [virtualgoodsdealer.com](https://www.virtualgoodsdealer.com) and contributors this site.

Please stay tuned for more content! We will be featuring all our creators for our drop on Oct. 9th, 2020 very soon. We are also planning to set up a submission process for contributing to this site.
