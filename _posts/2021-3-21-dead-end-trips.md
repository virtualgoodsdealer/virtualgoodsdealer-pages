**if/when earth is planet** 🅰️ 
it is always entirely possible
to travel as far as planet ♾️

**but**

the first thing you should know about ♾️
is that anything is **possible** but not everything is **advisable**.


You see, along the journey

somewhere between 🅰️ and ♾️

exists a point -- let's call it planet 🦓 --
at which **the journey itself becomes a dead-end**


*oversimply-put:*
if you've reached 🦓
it means you’ve traveled so far away from where you started
that the universe is now receding, in every direction,
faster than you will ever be able travel.


**what this really means for you, the traveler?**

Well, it means you may as well come to a permanent stop, relax, and learn to accept the following truths:

✅You will never reach your destination because the universe is expanding faster than you can travel.

✅You will never return home because the universe is expanding faster than you can travel.

✅You will never reach any destination, even if you travel forever.



**My Advice?**


Before reaching for the stars, you must first and foremost locate your 🦓 



for 🦓 = ♾️ = ♾️ = 🦓
