This is the third part of a multi-part series on creating your own static website for complete beginners. It will focus on using Jekyll with Github Pages and customizing Jekyll themes.<!--more--> In [part two]({% post_url 2020-11-23-simple-website-tutorial-part-two %}), we covered using git to save our work and Github Pages to host a webpage. Now, we will take our static site to the next level, making it easy to upload new content and manage a large number of web pages. Again, everything used to complete this tutorial is free! All you need is a computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux) and an internet connection.

## Why do we need to use Jekyll? ##
After following part two, you now know how to create a basic web page with HTML and CSS. That would be fine for a simple website with only a few pages. However, as mentioned at the end of that part, what if you wanted to create a website that you are adding content to everyday? For example, if you were to create a blog site similar to this one, how would you keep all of your pages organized and consistent over a period of several years? How would you make an edit to the layout of the site, such as adding a new link to the navigation bar, without manually editing every single HTML file? This is where [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} comes in. Jekyll is a static site generator. This means that it is software that takes folders of files that are formatted in specific ways and uses them to generate the HTML and CSS files that build up your website. Static site generators make it easier for you to start adding content to your site and keep it organized.

There are other static site generators. We are using Jekyll because it is compatible with Github Pages, the free hosting service we are using. Jekyll can also be run on other hosting services. You can also use Jekyll to build your site locally, and then host the generated website files on any hosting service. So, even though we are using these specific software and platforms, you and your content are not locked to them forever.

Another reason to use Jekyll is the amount of community made themes available for use with it. If you are not interested in learning the details of web development technology or customizing your website, you can easily install a theme with Jekyll and just start posting content. If you are interested in customizing your website, it is easy to work off of pre-made themes and get them to exactly what you want. For example, this site was built off of [mint theme by aidewoode](https://github.com/aidewoode/jekyll-theme-mint){:target="_blank"}. You can see how different this site looks now compared to the theme it was built off of.

## Installing Ruby and Jekyll ##
In order to install and run Jekyll, we have to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"}. Ruby is a programming language that Jekyll is built with. Like part two, the installation instructions differ if you are using a Mac or a Linux subsystem with Windows 10. So, skip to the section for the operating system you are using.
