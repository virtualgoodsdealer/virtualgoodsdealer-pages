Omnia Elbasheer, aka saqmemes, is a sudanese-american memer and collagist based in Fort Worth, TX. Her creations aim to harness the humor, artistry, and relatability of memes to build new narratives around difficult topics such as mental illness, gender-based violence, and inequality. In January 2021, saqmemes began working with virtualgoodsdealer as a content editor and curator.
