bod [包家巷] is an audiovisual artist from Tucson, AZ based in Berlin. Their work develops out of a philosophy of spatiotemporal collapse and being stupid in the face of terror.

Their recent project, [Music for Self Esteem](https://year0001.com/label/cases/yr0107), is a 37-track album dedicated to the people who made their music career possible and the birth of a new concept (self-esteem) in their lives. Music for Self Esteem was released on YEAR0001.
