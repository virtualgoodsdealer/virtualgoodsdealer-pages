GentleMoonBell [Gently Made Plush] is created by Melva Harris. Based in Queens, NY, she is a jack of all trades. Melva loves being a sewist, creating cute and cuddly creatures, but is also a multi-streamer who streams whatever her favorite thing is at the time, whether it be gaming or a cute diy. In the near future she wants to create her own line of plush.
