Adrianna is an architecture student based out of Atlanta, GA who loves to create in her free time. Her work represents a mixture of the playfulness that designing and creating can bring as well as the seriousness of structure and well constructed products; things she learned in architecture school. Adrianna plans to expand her collection in the future to include apparel and knit items.
