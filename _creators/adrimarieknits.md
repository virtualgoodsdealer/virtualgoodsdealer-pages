Adrianna Spence is an Atlanta-based creative making crotchet bag designs. She first began to crotchet at age 12, after she learned from her grandma, and loves the freedom and creativity that comes with working with yarn. She is inspired by nature and street style fashion, which reflects in her elegant yet playful designs. She plans on expanding her collection in the future to include apparel and knit items.
