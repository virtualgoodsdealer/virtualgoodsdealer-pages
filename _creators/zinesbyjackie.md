Jackie Liu is an artist and designer that works with comics, the web, and education. Throughout all of her work, she combines vulnerability, self-reflection, nostalgia, and humor to create safe spaces for others to know themselves better and thrive creativity.

"Zines by Jackie" is her effort to create such spaces in tech, design, and art. Developing an ongoing series, she hopes to create playful, welcoming, and socially-centered ways to learn about technology and our relationships to it.
