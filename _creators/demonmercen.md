"I'm a demon of sadness, through my grief I take the trash I collect and make it into fun items ppl can wear use and have, sometimes I make things from nothing as well, magic gang shit. I hope my love for the world is radiated through my collection  and people feel it cause I do love you all!!" - demonmercen
