Steph Lau is a mixed media artist based in New York, her work ranging from textile pieces to 3D animations. She crafts worlds reimagined from our realities, often with twists inspired by her love for the natural world and man-made constructs of beauty. As a next step, she wants to further develop story-telling through motion work.
