Soft_G0th has been drawing since she was 12. What started out as doodles of cute anime boys and portraits of her favorite Visual Kei bandmembers slowly shifted into an all-encompassing passion, more akin to a lifestyle then a hobby. 

Growing and traveling with her, Soft_G0th’s passion for art evolved especially rapidly when she traveled to Tokyo and took up modeling; borrowing features from the beautiful faces she saw while working, exploring clubs, and making fast friends in her adventures. As a ‘people’ driven artist, she takes inspiration not only from those around her, but also from her own experience as a black queer woman: and centering that experience is integral to the Soft_G0th fantasy.
